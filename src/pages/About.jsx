        <div className="site-inner story">
          <p>
            Most blood donation efforts run on a calendar: a drive gets
            scheduled, volunteers show up, and then the list goes quiet until
            the next one. That works for planned surgeries. It doesn't work
            for the 2 a.m. emergency, the sudden complication, the patient who
            can't wait three weeks for the next scheduled event.
          </p>
          <p>
            Community Blood was built to close that gap. Instead of asking
            people to remember a drive date, we ask them to register once —
            their blood type, their contact details, where they are — and we
            keep that on file. When a real, verified request comes in that
            matches their type, we reach out directly. No newsletter, no
            guesswork, just a call when it actually matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're a small, local operation, not a hospital system or a
            national charity. That's deliberate: it lets us move fast, verify
            requests directly with the people asking for help, and keep the
            whole process transparent to the donors who make it possible.
